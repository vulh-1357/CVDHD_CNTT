## EDUCATION
*   **University of Engineering and Technology**
    VNU, Hanoi
    Oct. 2022 – Present
    Bachelor of Science in Information Technology; GPA: 3.57

## PROJECTS
*   **A Method for Generating Web Application UI Test Cases**:
    **Description**: Developed an automated testing method that generates UI test cases from natural language descriptions and images. The approach integrates NLP, traditional methods and computer vision to simulate UI behaviors.
    **Role**: Researched, implemented, and optimized the validating result method for test case generation pipeline.
*   **AWS basic machine learning pipeline**: Demonstrate how to deploy an AI model on AWS SageMaker using a custom Docker image. Covers the entire workflow, including creating a training job, deploying an inference endpoint, and invoking predictions.
*   **A simple CI/CD pipeline for fullstack projects**: Provides a simple on-prime CI / CD pipeline implementation to automate security scanning, building, testing, and deployment of a containerized application on Kubernetes. Integrates SAST, SCA, DAST, performance testing, and Telegram notifications for reporting.
*   **Triton Inference Server**: Provides an example of customizing a Python backend for the Triton Inference Server. The implementation demonstrates how to modify the Triton server to support specific and efficient deep learning inference workflows.
*   **Billard Shop**: An e-commerce platform built on Magento 2, designed to sell billiard supplies online. This project provides a Dockerized environment for easy deployment and management.
*   **Q Airline**: A full stack web application that provides flight information and booking support. This project provides a Dockerized environment for easy mock deployment.
*   **Minbert**: A mini BERT model with multiple layers and pretraining it using contrastive learning for the Quora Question Pairs task.
*   **English Learning Application**: Bilingual (English-Vietnamese and Vietnamese-English) dictionary features and interactive vocabulary games like Hangman and Crossword.
*   **Dissneland Game**: A top-down action game where players control a swordsman to defeat enemies and progress through levels.

Note: The project details are available at www.cuongnv.social.
