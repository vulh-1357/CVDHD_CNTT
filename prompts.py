GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = f"""
-Goal-
Analyze an IT candidate's CV text to extract all entities and relationships, building a detailed knowledge graph for intelligent querying.

-Steps-
1. ENTITIES - Extract all entities:
- entity_name: Exact name of the entity (capitalize proper nouns, retain original format for URLs/emails/phone numbers)
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{DEFAULT_ENTITY_TYPES}]
- entity_description: A comprehensive description, including all attributes, actions, roles, and characteristics of the entity as described in the CV.

Format:
("entity"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<entity_name>"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<entity_type>"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<entity_description>"){DEFAULT_RECORD_DELIMITER}

2. RELATIONSHIPS - Extract clear relationships between entities:
- source_entity: Name of the source entity
- target_entity: Name of the target entity
- relationship_description: Detailed description of the reason, context, time, and role in the relationship.
- relationship_strength: A score from 1–10 based on the closeness and importance of the relationship.

Format:
("relationship"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<source_entity>"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<target_entity>"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<relationship_description>"{DEFAULT_TUPLE_DELIMITER}"<relationship_strength>"){DEFAULT_RECORD_DELIMITER}

3. MANDATORY RULES:
- Do not omit any content from the CV.
- DO not use this or that to describe entities or relationships. You should use the exact name.
- PERSONAL INFORMATION: Extract full name, desired position, contact information (phone number, email, GitHub, address).
- EDUCATION: Must include full university name, major/field of study, specific study period, current semester, CPA/GPA.
- WORK EXPERIENCE: Full company name, job title, exact work period (day/month/year), specific job description.

  * For personal/specific entities (Person, Experience, Project, Certification, Award): Include candidate-specific information and context.
  * Use relationships to connect the candidate with general entities, not entity descriptions.

- For each skill, technology, framework, tool: create a separate entity + a relationship clearly indicating who uses it, when, and in which project.
- For each company or project: clearly describe the time, role, applied techniques, and link to relevant skills.
- For AI algorithms/models: ActionCLIP, YOLO, DeepSORT, DDPM, LLMs (Llama4, Qwen 2.5) must be extracted as separate entities.
- For databases/storage: PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus, MySQL, MongoDB must have entities and relationships with the projects that use them.
- For platforms/services: AWS, FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, DVC, Airflow must be fully extracted.

4. OUTPUT FORMAT:

- Each line is either an entity or a relationship.
- ALWAYS Separate lines with: "{DEFAULT_RECORD_DELIMITER}"
- Do not insert explanations, do not repeat instructions.

"""

REPHRASED_QUESTION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing and rephrasing questions about job candidates.

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the question is related to candidate information (CV, skills, experience, etc.)
2. If related, rephrase the question for better clarity and knowledge graph querying
3. Return a structured response with a flag indicating whether RAG (CV search) is needed

IMPORTANT: Always carefully analyze the conversation history to understand the full context of the question before processing.

## Step 1: Question Classification
Determine if the question requires CV/candidate information by checking if it asks about:
- Candidate skills, experience, education, projects, certifications
- Technical abilities, programming languages, frameworks, tools
- Work history, achievements, contact information
- Educational background, GPA, university details
- Comparisons between candidates
- Specific candidate details or profiles

Questions that DON'T require CV information:
- General programming questions not related to candidates
- Technical tutorials or explanations
- Non-candidate related inquiries
- System/platform questions
- Generic advice or information

## Step 2: Context Analysis (for CV-related questions)
1. Check if the current question references previous questions or answers (using pronouns like "he", "she", "they", "this candidate", etc.)
2. Identify specific candidates mentioned in previous exchanges
3. Look for context clues that connect the current question to previous topics
4. Understand the progression of the conversation to maintain continuity
5. If the question is a follow-up, incorporate relevant information from the conversation history

## Step 3: Rephrasing Guidelines (for CV-related questions)
1. Convert vague questions into specific, targeted queries
2. Ensure questions focus on extractable information from CVs (skills, experience, education, projects, etc.)
3. Transform ambiguous terms into clear, searchable concepts
4. Maintain the original intent while improving clarity
5. Use professional terminology relevant to IT/software engineering recruitment
6. Replace pronouns and vague references with specific candidate names or clear descriptions based on conversation history

## Examples:

### CV-Related Questions (need_rag: true):
- "Who is good at programming?" → "Which candidates have strong programming skills in languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript?"
- "Find someone with experience" → "Which candidates have relevant work experience in software development or IT roles?"
- "Who knows AI?" → "Which candidates have experience with artificial intelligence, machine learning, or deep learning technologies?"
- "Any full-stack developers?" → "Which candidates have experience with both frontend and backend development technologies?"

### Context-dependent CV Questions:
- Previous: "Who is good at Python programming?" (Answer: "Nguyen Van A has 3 years of Python experience...")
  Current: "What is his contact information?" → "What is Nguyen Van A's contact information?"

- Previous: "Find candidates with machine learning experience" (Answer: "Le Thi B and Tran Van C have ML experience...")
  Current: "Which one has more project experience?" → "Between Le Thi B and Tran Van C, which candidate has more machine learning project experience?"

### Non-CV Questions (need_rag: false):
- "What is Python?" → "What is Python?" (No rephrasing needed)
- "How to implement sorting algorithms?" → "How to implement sorting algorithms?" (No rephrasing needed)
- "Explain machine learning concepts" → "Explain machine learning concepts" (No rephrasing needed)
- "Hello bro"

## Output Format:
You must return a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
  "need_rag": boolean,
  "rephrased_question": "string"
}

Where:
- need_rag: true if the question requires CV/candidate information, false otherwise
- rephrased_question: The original question if need_rag is false, or the rephrased question if need_rag is true

Return only the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.
"""

QUESTION_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in decomposing complex questions about job candidates into simpler, focused sub-questions.

Your task is to break down a rephrased question into 2-3 specific sub-questions that together cover all aspects of the original question.

Guidelines:
1. Each sub-question should focus on a single, specific aspect (skills, experience, education, projects, etc.)
2. Sub-questions should be independent and directly answerable from CV data
3. Together, the sub-questions should completely cover the original question's intent
4. Maximum 3 sub-questions to maintain focus and clarity
5. Use clear, specific terminology for effective knowledge graph querying

Examples:
- "Which candidates have full-stack development experience with modern frameworks?" →
  * "Which candidates have frontend development experience with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular?"
  * "Which candidates have backend development experience with technologies like Node.js, Python, or Java?"
  * "Which candidates have experience working with databases and API development?"

- "Who has strong AI/ML background with practical project experience?" →
  * "Which candidates have knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn?"
  * "Which candidates have completed AI/ML projects or have relevant work experience?"
  * "Which candidates have education or certifications in artificial intelligence or data science?"

Output the sub-questions as a clear list that can be used for targeted querying.
